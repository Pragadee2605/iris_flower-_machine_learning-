**Irish Flower Classification Android App üå∏**


This is my first Android application leveraging machine learning with TorchScript to classify Irish flowers. The app is designed to identify flower species from user-provided inputs using a trained machine learning model.

**Features ‚ú®**

**Machine Learning Integration:** Built using TorchScript for efficient model inference on Android.

**Irish Flower Classification:** Identifies the species of Irish flowers with high accuracy.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.

**Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è**

**Android Studio:** For app development.

**Kotlin:** Programming language for the Android application.

**TorchScript:** For deploying the ML model.

**Pre-trained ML Model:** Trained on the Irish flower dataset (based on the famous Iris dataset).
